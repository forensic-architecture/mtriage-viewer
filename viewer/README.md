NOTE: mtriage-viewer was built with Node 16. You're likely on a newer version, but will need to downgrade in order to view. We recommend using [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) in the (likely) case you have multiple versions of node on your computer. Once installed just run `nvm install 16` and `nvm use 16` and you should be set.
